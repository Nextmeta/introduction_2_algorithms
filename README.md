# Introduction To Algorithms

This repo is contains source code for sample algorithms of book <b><i>Introduction To Algorithms</i></b>.</br>
All of these codes are implemented in three languages(C, C++, Assembly).
I have divided different languages into different directories.</br>
c++ in directory "cplusplus", c in directory "purec", assmebly in directory "pureasm".
